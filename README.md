## Why Readpic

macOS image viewers are almost always paid — Pixave ($9.99), PicView ($9.99), Lynx ($16.99), ApolloOne ($14.99), Photo Mechanic ($139). Readpic delivers the same (or better) capability set **for free**.

Readpic sits in the sweet spot between macOS Preview and heavyweight tools like XnView — **more capable than any free native viewer, lighter and faster than any cross-platform alternative**.

### App size comparison

| Readpic | PicView | Pixave | qView | ApolloOne | Pixea | XnView MP |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **4 MB** | ~6 MB | ~7 MB | ~44 MB | ~32 MB | ~194 MB | ~103 MB |

Highlights:

- **Polished, intuitive UI** — clean and minimal interface built with SwiftUI, following macOS design conventions; XnView MP offers more features but its interface feels cluttered and dated with a Windows-era layout
- **Free + open source + full-featured** — the only macOS image viewer that combines MIT license, 30+ formats, batch operations, and a pro-level info panel at zero cost
- **Zero network, total privacy** — no telemetry, no update checks, no data collection; everything runs locally
- **M-chip only optimization** — built exclusively for Apple Silicon, no Intel compatibility overhead; faster startup, lower memory, smoother scrolling
- **ZIP / CBZ browsing** — open comic archives directly without extraction
- **Pro tools built in** — histogram, color picker, EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata, batch convert, batch rename — all in one free package
- **Subfolder recursive scanning** — open a parent folder and browse all nested images, auto-grouped by subfolder

## Support

Readpic is completely free and open source. It is also a vibe coding project that started from a simple frustration: most good macOS image viewers are paid, so I wanted to make a genuinely free one.

If you are willing and have a little room to spare, you can choose to support the project. Donation or not, every feature stays exactly the same. Thank you for using Readpic either way.
